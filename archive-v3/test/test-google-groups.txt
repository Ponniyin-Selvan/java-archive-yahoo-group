EVERY LITERATURE LOVING PERSON HAS HIS OWN FAVOURITES
AND REASONS ATTACHED TO IT. IN MY OPINION,  IT DEPENDS
UPON WHERE WE IDENTIFY US. PS IS A STORY OF POLITICS
COMBINED WITH REVENGE, NEEDHI AND OTHER ASPECTS (VERY
LONG BOSS), WHEREAS SS HAS TO DO IT WITH WAR AND LOVE
AND WE ALL KNOW ALL IS FAIR IN WAR AND LOVE. MAY BE
THAT'S THE REASON U ATTACH SO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO SS.
IT ALSO HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH UR ORDER OF READING
WHICH BOOK DID U READ FIRST MATTERS.

I CANNOT SAY THAT AFTER MY READING OF PS THAT HE NEVER
FALLED FOR ANYONE, BUT TOPMOST IN MY MIND WAS
KUNDAVAI, PROBABLY HE HAD OTHER VISIONS OR PROBABLY HE
HAS REALLY THOUGHT ABT HER ONLY. WHATEVER U HAVE
SHARED WILL ALSO BE SAID BY PERIYA PAZHUVETRAYAR IN
THE LAST CHAPTER THAT VT NEVER FALL FOR NANDINI. IN
FEW INSTANCES HE HAD LITTLE DILEMAS BUT OTHERWISE I
ALSO FEEL THAT HE NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. LET OUR
OTHER MEMBERS ALSO GIVE THEIR COMMENTS.
That was great.

I AM NOT AWARE OF IT, LET OF OTHER MEMBERS COMMENT,
BUT I WILL SURELY CHECK.

WELL UR TAKING ALL OUR JOBS, YES THERE ARE MANY
HISTORICAL FACTS I THINK OVER THE PERIOD WE WILL
DISCUSS ON ALL OF IT.

INTRESTING
FRIENDS, U KNOW WHAT RAJAJI HAS SAID ONCE IN A
GOVERNMENT FUNCTION : IF ANY LIBRARY DOES NOT HAVE PS
IN ITS COLLECTION, ITS EQUAL TO A TEMPLE NOT HAVING
IDOLS. 

DRAMA WENT ON WELL AND I WILL WRITE ELABORETLY LATTER
