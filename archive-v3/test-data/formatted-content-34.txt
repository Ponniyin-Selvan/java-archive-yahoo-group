<p>hi everybody,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in my view, nandini should be played by a person who should be arrogantly beautiful, should have a nice smile with a little bit of sorrow in her face but should be able to practise routhram well. so, i dont think any actress now has these qualities. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What abt vandhiya devan? He should be humorous, twinkling eyes, but at the the same time should be brave. So whats your choice?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Bye</p><p></p><p>&quot;Truly great friends are hard to find, difficult to leave, and impossible to forget.&quot;</p><p><br></p><hr><b>Do You Yahoo!?</b><br><a href="http://rd.yahoo.com/welcome/*http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> - Official partner of 2002 FIFA World Cup
